# Calm Weekly Planner (Rebuild)

Lightweight React + TypeScript weekly planner with a calming timeline UI.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- Data persists in browser `localStorage`.
- Backlog is global across weeks.
- Scheduled tasks are week-specific (Monday-start week key).
- Authentication is local device sign-in (name gate) to keep scope light.
